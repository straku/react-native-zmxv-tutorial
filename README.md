# react-native-zmxv-tutorial

First tries with React Native, code based on ongoing tutorial by [Zhen Wang](https://github.com/zmxv). Tutorial: [link](http://blog.zmxv.com/2016/01/lets-write-a-mobile-game-with-react-native.html). Thanks for great introduction!

Couple small additions / changes to code provided in tutorial:
- More `ES6`: imports, `const`
- React components written as `ES6` classes
- `Tile` code exported to seperate module with `PropTypes` defined
- Constants exported to seperate module
- Added `lodash`, `_.range()` used in few places instead of normal `for` loop
